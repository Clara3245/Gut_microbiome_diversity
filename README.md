# Gut_microbiome_diversity
Can gut microbiome diversity and functional pathways predict individual responses to dietary interventions or probiotics using machine learning?

- The gut microbiome's role in health is increasingly recognized, but predicting how individuals respond to interventions like diet or probiotics is a cutting-edge challenge.
- Existing datasets, such as from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) or American Gut Project, often include microbiome composition, metadata (e.g., diet, health status), and even metabolomic profiles, making this question feasible.
- This study would provide insights into personalized nutrition and therapeutic strategies, aligning with the trend toward precision medicine.
